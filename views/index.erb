<p>This is my home on the web. </p>

<p>The time is now <span id="time"> </span></p>

<p>This is a canvas element</p>

<canvas id="canvas" width="200" height="200">

<p>This template is standard HTML document with a single "page" container inside, unlike a <a href="page1.html" data-prefetch>multi-page template</a> that has multiple pages within it. We strongly recommend building your site or app as a series of separate pages like this because it's cleaner, more lightweight and works better without JavaScript.</p>
